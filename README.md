## Introduction

Completely made in Flutter, **Pandora Quest** is a simple quiz game about computer science. The user will test their CS knowledge to explore the rooms, defeat the trolls, and finally escape from Pandora.  
The goal is to make it to the end before losing all your health points. To do that, you will need to answer the trolls' questions correctly and make smart decisions regarding the use of your items.  
To make it more competitive, a timer tracks each gameplay duration so you can challenge yourself or your friends to complete the game as quickly as possible.

## Features

During your adventure, there are many different objects that you can pick up, each of which might have benefits or drawbacks. For example, some objects might be poisonous and inflict damage when used, while others can help you answer the trolls' questions.  

The number of rooms to cross can be customized to make the adventure longer and more difficult. The rooms are chosen randomly at each new gameplay session to make the experience less repetitive.  

There are two kinds of rooms:

### ENEMY ROOMS

Here you will find a troll that you need to defeat to progress. There are different kinds of trolls, each specializing in a different field of computer science. If you answer 3 questions correctly, you can continue your adventure, but for every wrong response, you receive damage. When your health drops below zero, it’s game over.  
In these rooms, you can use the objects in your inventory to help yourself.

### OBJECT ROOMS

Here you can relax a bit; you will not find enemies. Sometimes, it’s possible to perform actions to obtain objects that will be stored in your inventory. Be careful, as some actions may give you an object at the cost of some health!
